# MOT Automation Week:

Hi, I'm Paul Farrell. Here's my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PostmanPaul540) and [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faz540/) 
I have been working at [Gear4music](https://www.gear4music.com/) in Manchester UK since Novenber 2019.

I started my testing journey in July 2012 where I started working as a Games Tester for Sony Computer Entertaintment Europe/PlayStation.

I'm using the challenges set in the [Ministry of Test Automation Week](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/what-is-automation-week/43663) as a technical exercise to keep my testing chops up or to explore new methods.
